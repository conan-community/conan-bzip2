## For Users

### Basic setup

    $ conan install bzip2/1.0.6@conan/stable

### Project setup

If you handle multiple dependencies in your project is better to add a *conanfile.txt*

    [requires]
    bzip2/1.0.6@conan/stable

    [generators]
    cmake

Complete the installation of requirements for your project running:

    $ mkdir build && cd build && conan install ..

Note: It is recommended that you run conan install from a build directory and not the root of the project directory.  This is because conan generates *conanbuildinfo* files specific to a single build configuration which by default comes from an autodetected default profile located in ~/.conan/profiles/default .  If you pass different build configuration options to conan install, it will generate different *conanbuildinfo* files.  Thus, they should not be added to the root of the project, nor committed to git.


## Build and package

The following command both runs all the steps of the conan file, and publishes the package to the local system cache.  This includes downloading dependencies from "build_requires" and "requires" , and then running the build() method.

    $ conan create . conan/stable


### Available Options
| Option        | Default | Possible Values  |
| ------------- |:----------------- |:------------:|
| shared      | False |  [True, False] |
| fPIC      | True |  [True, False] |


## Add Remote

Conan Community has its own Bintray repository, however, we are working to distribute all package in the Conan Center:

    $ conan remote add conan-center "https://conan.bintray.com"
